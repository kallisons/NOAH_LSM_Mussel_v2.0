NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0
====================

Intertidal Mussel Bed Temperature Model derived from the National Weather Service NOAH Land Surface Model.  The model, which mimics the thermal properties of a mussel bed exposed to tidal inundation and wave run-up, predicts mussel bed temperatures from atmospheric and oceanic data.

Folders
---------

**ExampleInputData** - The shell script that runs the model will read input files from this folder.  The folder contains a file with example input data that can be used for testing the model after compilation.  The format for the file names is a six digit code for the site (USCASC), the shore level (1.00), and the year (2002).  It is important to keep the exact same format in the file names in order to run the  model.

**ExampleModelOutput** - The shell script that runs the model will put output files from the model in this folder.  The RCode will access the model output from this folder.  

**ExampleProcessedOutput** - The folder contains three subfolders for output from the model that has been processed by R Code from the RCode_ProcessOutput folder.  

**Model** - The code for the model, NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0.f, and the shell script, RunModel_LSMM2.sh, to run the model are in this folder.

**RCode_ProcessOutput** - The R Code files to process the output are contained in this folder.

**TestFiles** - Contains test files to verify the example output was generated correctly by the model and R scripts.  

-------------------
Compiling the model
-------------------

Open a shell window and change the directory to the Model folder inside the NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0 folder.  

Change directory:  

    cd NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/Model

Command to compile model:

    gfortran NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0.f -o LSMM2


------------------
Running the model
------------------
The model is run using a shell script.  Site codes (site), shore level (point), year, and contact proportion at midpoint of the mussel bed (CNTCT) can be modified in this file.  Site codes, shore levels, and year are input file characteristics.  Contact proportion at the midpoint of the mussel bed alters a parameter in the model.

Command to run model:

    sh RunModel_LSMM2.sh

Output files are written to the NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/ExampleModelOutput folder.

----------------------------
Verify example model output
----------------------------
Compare example model output created using the commands above to a set of test files to make sure the results are the same.  

Command to run comparison tests:

    sh RunTest_ModelOutput.sh

------------------------------------
Processing the model output with R
------------------------------------
The model output needs to be processed.  The following commands (1) extract mussel temperatures from a beddepth of 3 cm and convert the time to local solar noon using longitude of the site, (2) calculate survival, and (3) calculate maximum mussel temperature statistics.  The code for calculating mussel survival and maximum mussel temperature statistics requires (1).

Change directory:  

    cd NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/RCode_ProcessOutput

**(1) Extract mussel temperatures**

Command to run R code:

    RScript Step1_ModelOutputToMusselTemp.R

Output files are written to the NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/ExampleProcessedOutput/MusselTemperatures folder.

**(2) Calculate mussel survival**

Command to run R code:

    RScript MusselTempToMusselSurvival.R

Output files are written to the NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/ExampleProcessedOutput/MusselSurvival folder.

**(3) Calculate maximum mussel temperature statistics**

Command to run R code:

    RScript CalculateMaxMusselTemp.R

Output files are written to the NOAH_LSM_Mussel_v2.0/ExampleProcessedOutput/MaxMusselTemperatures folder.

-----------------------
Verify example R output
-----------------------
Compare example R output created using the commands above to a set of test files to make sure the results are the same.

Command to run comparison tests:

    sh RunTest_ROutput.sh

-----------------
Model input data
-----------------
The model predicts mussel temperature from meteorological and oceanic data which is contained in an input file.  We have provided an example input data file in the ExampleInputData folder that can be processed with the commands listed above to determine mussel temperatures and survival. We imagine that there may be interest in running the model with different input data.  

To make new input files:

The input files have <=1 year of data.  The model input file has no header and contains the following space delimited columns:

* julian day of the year
* hour and minute in the hhmm format
* wind speed (m s^-1 at 10 m)
* air temperature (degrees C at 2 m)
* relative humidity (% at 2 m)
* surface pressure (mb)
* downwelling shortwave radiation (W m^-2)
* downwelling longwave radiation (W m^-2)
* precipitation rate (total inches)
* sea surface temperature (K)
* tide flag (high tide = 0, low tide = 1)

For time zone, we generally run the model with the time in UTC, and then Step1_ModelOutputToMusselTemp.R converts the time to solar noon using the longitude of the site.

The control files that provide the model with important information about the input data are currently set-up for a 6 minute time step, an entire year of data, and start with a julian day of 1 and time of 0.  The RunModel_LSMM2.sh file changes the control file for the leap years 2000, 2004, and 2008 to correctly input the data.

**Modifying the control files:**  
The control files for the model must be modified if new input files are created that have a different time step, length of time, or start on a different day.  Make changes to JDAY, TIME, SYDAYS, NRUN, and DT in the controlfile_top_leap_6min.txt and controlfile_top_noleap_6min.txt files before running the model with input files with different characteristics.  Add additional leap years to the RunModel_LSMM2.sh if needed.
